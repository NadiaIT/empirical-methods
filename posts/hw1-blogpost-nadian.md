## Blog Post: Paper Motivation Critique

> Zhang, A. X., Muller, M., Wang, D. (2020). [How do Data Science Workers Collaborate? Roles,
Workflows, and Tools](https://doi.org/10.1145/3392826). In Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction. 4, CSCW1, Article 22 (May 2020), (pp. 1-23). 

The paper aimed to understand the collaborative practices of data science teams from both the perspectives of technical (e.g., data scientist, engineers) and non-technical (e.g., managers, domain experts) team members. They designed an online survey targeting a large scale of users with 183 participants working in various roles (5 major roles). They reported the extent of interaction between these roles in different stages of the workflow and using different tools. They also identified the collaboration practices of the workers and discussed some design implications based on those to support the data science team collaboration.

### Description of problem

Interdisciplinary collaboration has always been considered as challenging which stands true for the modern machine learning projects as well. From the literature, it has been understood that data science collaboration is not the same as the traditional software development teams. As per the authors of the paper and other related papers, due to being engaged with more "exploration" process than "engineering" process, distinct skills and knowledges reside, and make the collaboration even more challenging.
The paper presents a rich literature overview in three bundles -
- HCI and CSCW research on data science work practices
- specific literature aiming to understand and support collaboration in data science
- proposed tools and features in data science 
The paper points out a gap in the current knowledge by arguing that the collaboration researches and tool supports till now have been focusing on the technical aspects only, ignoring the non-technical roles causing multidisciplinary problems (e.g., deep domain knowledge often only resides in domain experts mind). Also, the existing works focusing on data science practices mostly adopt interview research methods and a few use ethnographic research methods, falling short to generalize understanding from a larger user population. Thus, the authors of this paper wanted to gather a broader user perspective through a large-scale online survey to complement the existing qualitative narratives.


### Research questions
The research question that the paper aims to answer is -
> What is the extent of collaboration on data science teams?

## Overview of study design / methods 

The paper designed an online survey as the study method. The targeted participants are the employees of IBM, working in diverse roles. The participants are approached through slack channel having approximately 1000 employees, and 183 self-selected participants provided data. The survey questions were kept optional to encourage people to contribute. It consisted of questions about project, collaboration with team and roles in different phases, open-ended questions about tools used to collaborate in different workflow stages, and collaboration practices. The open-text responses were coded using a coding guideline set in advance.

### Critique

The authors of the paper seem to have a philosophical stance of a Positivist. The literature review is well-structured demonstrating a clear gap and hook (already stated in the description of the problem section). However, though the authors seem to have positivist view and they preferred quantitative approach, it seemed that they treated theory as a product of research similar to inductive researchers. They had precise survey questions about the answers they were looking for, thus there ought to be some theory, but this was implicit in the whole paper. The research question was very broad, and the authors attempted to relate that to tools, stages, practices, etc. However, the connections were not explicitly stated along with a theory. Additionally, the research suffers from the bias of self-reported data. Also, they stated the purpose why they used quantitative approach was to do a large-scale study that can be generalized unlike interviews, but in reality, it suffers from population bias as all the survey respondents were from IBM having similar tools, practices and cultures of a single company.
